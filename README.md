## The Problem

Building a real product requires more than great UI and frontend code. It's a coordinated effort across architecture, backend systems, state management, design patterns, and operational tooling.

But vibe-coding shortcuts these decisions. It produces something that works on day one, but collapses when confronted with real-world scale, reliability, and complexity.

Tools like Lovable and Bolt are excellent for rapidly generating frontend scaffolds. But when your system needs to:
- Remember a user from three days ago
- Orchestrate 50+ concurrent tasks
- Guarantee failure-safe execution

...vibe-coding breaks down.

## The Solution

**AutoRail eliminates this gap.**

It continuously interprets your generated code and automatically provisions the backend primitives your product actually needs:
- Stateful memory layers
- Workflow orchestration
- Guardrails
- Rate limiters
- Circuit-breaker patterns

The result: agents and applications that run on a stable, scalable, production-grade track from day one.

> Frontend generation gives you momentum. AutoRail gives you the infrastructure to sustain it.
