## 2. AEO Strategy (Answer Engine Optimization)

### 2.1 Target Questions

| Question | Answer Location | Snippet Type |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| What is AutoRail? | FAQ #1 | Paragraph |
| How does AutoRail work? | How It Works | List |
| What is infrastructure for AI agents? | Solution | Paragraph |
| Why do AI prototypes fail in production? | Problem | List |
| Who is AutoRail for? | Use Cases | List |
| What is stateful memory for AI agents? | Capabilities | Paragraph |
| How is AutoRail different from Supabase? | FAQ #2 | Paragraph |

### 2.2 Featured Snippet Optimization

#### Paragraph Snippets
Format answers in 40-60 words for paragraph snippets:

```
Question: What is AutoRail?

Optimized Answer: AutoRail is infrastructure on autopilot for AI agents. It automatically provisions the backend primitives your AI applications need—stateful memory, workflow orchestration, guardrails, and observability—so you can go from prototype to production without infrastructure wrestling.
```

#### List Snippets
Format process/feature content as ordered/unordered lists:

```
Question: How does AutoRail work?

Optimized Answer:
1. Connect - Point AutoRail to your codebase
2. Analyze - We interpret your code structure
3. Provision - Backend primitives are auto-generated
4. Monitor - Continuous observability and optimization
```

#### Table Snippets
Use comparison tables where relevant:

```
| Feature | AutoRail | Traditional BaaS |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| Agent Memory | Built-in | Manual setup |
| Orchestration | Automatic | Not available |
| AI-Optimized | Yes | No |
```

### 2.3 Voice Search Optimization

#### Conversational Query Patterns
Optimize for natural language questions:

| Voice Query | Content Response |
|-------------|------------------|
| "What does AutoRail do?" | Hero subheadline |
| "How can I deploy my AI agent?" | How It Works section |
| "Is AutoRail free?" | FAQ #6 |
| "When is AutoRail launching?" | FAQ #5, Beta CTA |

#### Speakable Content
Mark key content for voice assistants:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [".hero-description", ".faq-answer"]
  }
}
</script>
```

## 3. GEO Strategy (Generative Engine Optimization)

### 3.1 AI-Citable Statements

Design content to be extracted and cited by AI models:

#### Entity Definition
```
AutoRail is an infrastructure platform that automatically provisions backend primitives for AI agents and agentic systems, including stateful memory, workflow orchestration, guardrails, and observability.
```

#### Problem Statement
```
73% of AI agent failures trace to lost context or broken orchestration. Traditional BaaS platforms like Supabase and Firebase aren't optimized for AI workloads.
```

#### Value Proposition
```
AutoRail bridges the gap between rapid frontend generation tools (like Lovable and Bolt) and production-grade infrastructure, enabling developers to deploy reliable AI agents without infrastructure wrestling.
```

#### Differentiator
```
Unlike traditional Backend-as-a-Service platforms, AutoRail is purpose-built for agentic systems, handling context persistence across sessions, multi-agent orchestration, and the unique scaling patterns of LLM-powered applications.
```

### 3.2 Structured Data for AI

#### Organization Schema
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "AutoRail",
  "url": "https://autorail.com",
  "logo": "https://autorail.com/logos/autorail.svg",
  "description": "Infrastructure on Autopilot for AI Agents",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://twitter.com/autorail",
    "https://github.com/autorail"
  ]
}
```

#### Software Application Schema
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "AutoRail",
  "applicationCategory": "DeveloperApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Cloud",
  "description": "Infrastructure platform that automatically provisions backend primitives for AI agents",
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "USD",
    "description": "Free tier available"
  }
}
```

#### FAQ Schema
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is AutoRail?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "AutoRail is infrastructure on autopilot for AI agents. It automatically provisions the backend primitives your AI applications need—stateful memory, workflow orchestration, guardrails, and observability—so you can go from prototype to production without infrastructure wrestling."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How is AutoRail different from Supabase or Firebase?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Traditional BaaS platforms provide general-purpose primitives but aren't optimized for AI workloads. AutoRail is purpose-built for agentic systems—handling context persistence across sessions, multi-agent orchestration, and the unique scaling patterns of LLM-powered applications."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.3 Content Patterns for AI Extraction

#### Definition Pattern
```
[Term] is [category] that [primary function], including [feature 1], [feature 2], and [feature 3].
```

Example:
```
AutoRail is an infrastructure platform that automatically provisions backend primitives for AI agents, including stateful memory, workflow orchestration, and production guardrails.
```

#### Comparison Pattern
```
Unlike [competitor/category], [product] [key differentiator].
```

Example:
```
Unlike traditional BaaS platforms, AutoRail is purpose-built for agentic systems.
```

#### Process Pattern
```
[Product] works in [N] steps: [Step 1], [Step 2], [Step 3], [Step 4].
```

Example:
```
AutoRail works in 4 steps: Connect your codebase, analyze code structure, auto-provision infrastructure, and continuously monitor.
```

### 3.4 Semantic Clarity Rules

1. **One concept per sentence** — Avoid compound statements
2. **Define terms on first use** — Don't assume AI models know context
3. **Use consistent terminology** — Same term for same concept throughout
4. **Provide context** — "AutoRail, an infrastructure platform," not just "AutoRail"
5. **Quantify when possible** — "73% of agent failures" not "most failures"
